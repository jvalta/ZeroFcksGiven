# ZeroFcksGiven
A screensaver built with windows forms and C#.

It attempts to give a fuck for 82 seconds, after that it fails and shows an error for 5 seconds before starting over.

Basic functionality works, but this is still a work in progress. Next features to implement:
- Make the forms change place when they are run.
- Add options for configuring the attempt time.
